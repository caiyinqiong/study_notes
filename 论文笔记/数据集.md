  > 数据集简介：The query of WikiHop is constructed with entities and relations from WikiData, while supporting documents are from WIKIREADING. A bipartite graph connecting entities and documents is ﬁrst built and the answer for each query is located by traversal on this graph. Candidates that are type-consistent with the answer and share the same relation in query with the answer are included, resulting in a set of candidates. Thus, WIKIHOP is a multi-choice style reading comprehension data set。。。。。There are totally about 43K samples in training set, 5K samples in development set and 2.5K samples in test set.。。。。The task is to predict the correct answer given a query and multiple supporting documents.。。。。Each question is associated with an average of 13.7 supporting Wikipedia passages, each with 36.4 tokens on average.

  > 数据集简介：Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning Dataset is a large-scale MRC dataset requiring commonsense reasoning. It consists of passage-question-answer tuples, collected from CNN and Daily Mail news articles. In each tuple, the passage is formed by the ﬁrst few paragraphs of a news article, with named entities recognized and marked. The question is a sentence from the rest of the article, with a missing entity speciﬁed as the golden answer. The goal is to ﬁnd the golden answer among the entities marked in the passage, which can be deemed as an extractive MRC task.

  > The questions are user queries issued to the Bing search engine and the contextual passages are from real web documents. The data has been split into a training set (153,725 QA pairs), a dev set (12,467 QA pairs) and a test set (101,092 questions with unpublished answers).

CoQA contains text passages from diverse domains, conversational questions and answers developed for each passage, as well as rationales (i.e., text spans extracted from given passages) to support answers.
